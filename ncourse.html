		<p>Idsall Sixth Form Centre offers a range of subjects at A-Levels, combinations of which can be chosen to prepare students for training and employment, or entry to courses currently on offer at Universities. A-Level courses involve two years of full time study.<br><br>Students must achieve a grade total of at least 8 in English Language and Mathematics, with no grade less than a 4.
			Students must have an average points score (APS) of 4.5 or higher.
			Most A-Levels require a grade 5 at GCSE or M2 at BTEC in that subject. However, some subjects, such as Maths, Further Maths, the Sciences and English Literature, require a Grade 6 at GCSE. Please check the specific requirements for each subject at A-Level and BTEC.
			If you have not studied the A-Level or BTEC subject at GCSE, then there may be other grades used to decide entry. Feel free to get in touch if you have a specific query about this.
			If a student wishes to study A-Levels alongside any BTEC qualification they must achieve the minimum requirements to study A-Levels and the criteria for the specific BTEC.</p>
