			<p>Idsall School is situated on the outskirts of the small country town of Shifnal in Shropshire, about five miles from the centre of Telford with all its amenities. Nearby are the other towns of Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury.

				An easy way of reaching us is to leave the M54 at Junction 4 and follow the A464 to Shifnal. At the roundabout, take the 3rd exit along Victoria Road. Just before the railway bridge, turn left and immediately right into Aston Street (Barclays Bank is on the corner). Follow Aston Street for about a quarter of a mile then turn left and immediately right into Coppice Green Lane and the school is along this road on the left. Travelling from Bridgnorth on the B4379, you need to turn left into Innage Road at the first roundabout, then turn right at the second roundabout into Victoria Road and proceed as above.
				<br><br>
				RAIL ACCESS - Shifnal Railway Station is half a mile from the school on the Wolverhampton / Birmingham to Telford / Shrewsbury line. This line is managed by London Midland.</p>
