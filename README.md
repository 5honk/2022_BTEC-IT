The project found in this repository was graded a Distinction Star (2022)

During my time in A-levels, I had to make a final project for my BTEC Information Technology. We were tasked to make a functional html website that was a redesign of my schools website, while adhering 
to the clients request about the website. The project was supposed to be created through Adobe Dream weaver but since I wanted to challenge myself for this project, I decided to code the html, css and javascript 
myself via Visual Studio Code. 

To meet the criteria of a distinction, the work had to follow some rules:
          + Inlcude accesibility features 
          + Showcase Javascript
          + Implement Widgets with user functionality 
          + Examples, explaination and the code on the documentation
